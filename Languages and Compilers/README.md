> Don't be a cookie-cutter programmer. Instead, build tools for users and other programmers. Consider the history of the textile and steel industries: Do you want to build machines and tools, or just operate them?  

â€” _Ras Bodik at the start of his compiler course_  

Most programmers learn languages, while most computer scientists learn _about_ languages. This gives computer scientists a significant advantage over programmers, even in programming itself! Their knowledge is more generalizable, allowing them to understand the inner workings of a new language more deeply and quickly than those who have only learned specific languages.  

Our recommended introductory book is the excellent [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html) by Bob Nystrom, available online for free. It is well-structured, highly engaging, and ideal for those who primarily want to develop a better understanding of programming languages and language tools. We suggest taking the time to go through the entire book and attempting the "challenges" that spark your interest.  

A more traditional recommendation is [Compilers: Principles, Techniques & Tools](https://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-2nd/dp/0321486811?pldnSite=1), also known as "The Dragon Book." Unfortunately, it is not designed for self-study but rather for instructors planning 1-2 semesters' worth of coursework.  

If you choose to use The Dragon Book, it is almost essential to select specific topics, ideally with the help of a mentor. If anything, we recommend using it as a supplementary reference alongside a video lecture series. Our recommended series is [Alex Aiken's course on edX](https://www.edx.org/course/compilers).
