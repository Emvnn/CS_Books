Learning about database systems as a self-learner is more challenging than in other fields. It is a relatively new discipline (emerging in the 1970s) with strong commercial incentives, meaning that some key ideas remain proprietary. Additionally, many authors of excellent textbooks have opted to join or start companies instead.

Given these circumstances, we recommend that self-learners generally avoid traditional textbooks and start with lecture recordings from [CS 186](https://cs186berkeley.net/), Joe Hellerstein's database course at Berkeley, before gradually moving on to research papers.

A particularly noteworthy paper for newcomers is ["Architecture of a Database System"](https://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/fntdb07-architecture.pdf), which uniquely provides an overview of how relational database management systems (RDBMS) function. This serves as a solid foundation for further study.

_Readings in Database Systems_, commonly known as the ["Red Book" on databases](http://www.redbook.io/), is a collection of papers compiled and edited by Peter Bailis, Joe Hellerstein, and Michael Stonebraker. For those who have mastered the content of CS 186, the Red Book should be the next stop.

If you insist on using an introductory textbook, we recommend [Database Management Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Database-Management-Systems-Raghu-Ramakrishnan/dp/0072465638/?pldnSite=1) by Ramakrishnan and Gehrke. For more advanced students, Jim Grayâ€™s classic [Transaction Processing: Concepts and Techniques](https://www.amazon.com/Transaction-Processing-Concepts-Techniques-Management/dp/1558601902) is worthwhile, though we do not recommend it as a first resource.

Finally, data modeling is an often-overlooked and poorly taught aspect of working with databases. Our recommended book on this topic is [Data and Reality: A Timeless Perspective on Perceiving and Managing Information in Our Imprecise World](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Reality-Perspective-Perceiving-Information/dp/1935504215).
