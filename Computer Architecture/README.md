Computer Architecture—sometimes referred to as "Computer Systems" or "Computer Organization"—provides an essential first look into the inner workings of computers beneath the surface of software. It is often an overlooked topic among self-taught engineers.

Our favorite book for an introduction is [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/home.html), and a typical introductory course in computer architecture based on this book would cover most of chapters 1-6 [here](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/courses.html).

We love CS:APP for its practical, programmer-oriented approach. Although the book does not cover everything about computer architecture, it is a great starting point for those who want to understand computer systems in order to write faster, more efficient, and reliable software.

For those seeking a gentler introduction with a balance between hardware and software topics, we recommend "_The Elements of Computing Systems_," also known as "Nand2Tetris." This ambitious work aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how everything in a computer works. Each chapter addresses building a part of the system, from writing basic logic gates in HDL, to the CPU and assembler, and even an application the size of a Tetris game.

We recommend working through the first six chapters of the book and completing the associated projects. This will deepen your understanding of the relationship between machine architecture and the software running on it.

The first half of the book (and all associated projects) is available for free on the [Nand2Tetris website](https://www.nand2tetris.org/). It is also available as a [Coursera course with accompanying videos](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer).

The simplicity and coherence that Nand2Tetris strives for come at the cost of depth. Specifically, two very important concepts in modern computer architecture, namely pipelining and memory hierarchy, are largely absent from this text.

Once you are familiar with the content of Nand2Tetris, we recommend returning to CS:APP or considering ["Computer Organization and Design"](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Organization-Design-Fifth-Architecture/dp/0124077269?pldnSite=1) by Patterson and Hennessy, an excellent and now classic textbook. Not every section of the book is essential, so we recommend following the [CS61C course](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp15/) "Great Ideas in Computer Architecture" from Berkeley for selected readings. The lecture notes and exercises are available online, and past lectures can be found [on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL-XXv-cvA_iCl2-D-FS5mk0jFF6cYSJs_).
