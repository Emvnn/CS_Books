# Introduction to Computer Science

Most undergraduate computer science programs begin with an "Introduction" to computer programming. The best versions of these courses are not only for beginners but also for those who may have missed essential concepts and programming models when first learning to code.

Our standard recommendation for this content is the classic *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* (SICP), which is available online for free as a [textbook](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml) and as a series of [MIT video lectures](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/index.xhtml). While these lectures are excellent, we instead recommend the [SICP lectures by Brian Harvey](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter) from Berkeley’s CS 61A course. These lectures are more refined and better suited for new students than the MIT lectures.

We recommend working through at least the first three chapters of SICP and completing the exercises. Additionally, practicing small programming tasks, such as those found on [exercism](https://exercism.org/), can be very beneficial.

Since this guide was first published in 2016, one of the most frequently asked questions has been whether we now recommend a more recent recording of Berkeley's CS 61A by John DeNero, or the corresponding textbook [Composing Programs](https://composingprograms.com/), which follows the "tradition of SICP" but uses Python. We believe these resources by DeNero are also excellent, and some students may prefer them. However, we still suggest starting with SICP, Scheme, and Brian Harvey’s lectures as the primary resources.

Why? Because SICP is unique in its ability to fundamentally change the way you think about computers and programming—at least potentially. Not everyone will have this experience. Some may dislike the book, while others may not get past the first few pages. But the potential gain makes it worth the attempt.

If you do not enjoy SICP, try *Composing Programs*. If that still doesn’t appeal to you, give [How to Design Programs](http://htdp.org/) a shot. If none of these efforts feel worthwhile, it might be a sign to focus on other topics for now and revisit programming in a year or two.

### Final Note
This guide is NOT intended for absolute beginners in programming. We assume you are already competent in programming without a formal computer science background and want to fill knowledge gaps. The inclusion of a section on programming serves as a reminder that there is always more to learn. For those who have never programmed but would like to start, this [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq/#wiki_getting_started) may be a better fit.
