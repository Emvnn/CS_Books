# Math for CS

> If people don't believe that mathematics is simple, it's only because they don't know how complicated life is.  
_-John von Neumann_

In a way, computer science is a branch of applied mathematics. Although many software engineers try – with varying degrees of success – to ignore this, we encourage you to engage directly with it through study. If you do this successfully, you'll have a significant competitive advantage over those who don't.

The most relevant area of mathematics for computer science is generally called "discrete mathematics," where "discrete" is the opposite of "continuous" and represents a collection of interesting mathematical topics outside of calculus. With this vague definition, it makes little sense to cover the entire breadth of "discrete mathematics." A more realistic goal is to develop a working understanding of logic, combinatorics, probability theory, set theory, graph theory, and some number theory for cryptography. Linear algebra is an additional valuable field of study due to its importance in computer graphics and machine learning.

Our recommended starting point for discrete mathematics is the [lecture notes by László Lovász](https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/teaching/discrete_math_fall_2005/dmbook.pdf). Prof. Lovász has managed to make the content accessible and intuitive, so this serves as a better starting point than more formal texts.

For a more advanced treatment, we recommend [Mathematics for Computer Science](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring17/mcs.pdf), the lecture notes in book form for the MIT course of the same name. The associated video lectures are also [freely available](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video_galleries/video-lectures/), and they are our recommended video lectures for discrete mathematics.

For linear algebra, we suggest starting with the video series [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab), followed by the [textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Linear-Algebra-Gilbert-Strang/dp/0980232775/) and [video lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/) by Gilbert Strang.
