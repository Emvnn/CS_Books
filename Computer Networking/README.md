> You cannot look into a crystal ball and see the future. What the Internet will become is what society makes of it.  

â€” _Bob Kahn_

Since much of software development revolves around web servers and clients, computer networks are one of the most immediately useful areas of computer science. Many self-learners who methodically study networking find that they finally understand terms, concepts, and protocols they have been surrounded by for years.

Our favorite book on the subject is [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Networking-Top-Down-Approach-7th/dp/0133594149/?pldnSite=1). The small projects and exercises in the book are highly valuable, and we especially appreciate the "Wireshark Labs," which have been generously made [available online](http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/).

For those who prefer video lectures, we recommend Stanfordâ€™s course [Introduction to Computer Networking](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoCMsyE1cvdWKsLVyf6cPwCLDIZnOj0NS), which was originally available on Stanfordâ€™s MOOC platform Lagunita but is now only accessible as unofficial playlists on YouTube.
