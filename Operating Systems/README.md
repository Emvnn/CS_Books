# Operating Systems

[<img align="right" wedith="500" src="![ostep](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce5c96c3-1f01-4adc-b99d-d800cfe4f54f)">](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)

[Operating System Concepts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1118063333/) (the "Dinosaur Book") and [Modern Operating Systems](https://www.amazon.com/dp/013359162X/) are the classics on operating systems. Both have received criticism due to their lack of clarity and general unfriendliness toward students.

_Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces_ is a good alternative, which is [freely available online](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/). We particularly appreciate the structure and readability of the book, and consider the exercises to be worthwhile.

After OSTEP, we recommend studying the design decisions of specific operating systems, with books in the style of "{Operating System Name} Internals," such as [Lions' Commentary on Unix](https://www.amazon.com/Lions-Commentary-Unix-John/dp/1573980137/), [Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Implementation-FreeBSD-Operating-System/dp/0321968972/), and [Mac OS X Internals](https://www.amazon.com/Mac-OS-Internals-Systems-Approach/dp/0321278542/). For Linux, we recommend Robert Loveâ€™s fantastic [Linux Kernel Development](https://www.amazon.com/Mac-OS-Internals-Systems-Approach/dp/0321278542).

A good way to solidify your understanding of operating systems is to read the source code of a small kernel and add new features. One option is [xv6](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/xv6.html), a port of Unix V6 to ANSI C and x86, maintained for a course at MIT. OSTEP includes an appendix with potential [xv6 labs](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/lab-projects-xv6.pdf) full of great ideas for possible projects.
