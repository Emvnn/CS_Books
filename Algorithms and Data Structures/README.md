_— Richard Hamming_

We wholeheartedly agree with decades of wisdom that familiarity with common algorithms and data structures is one of the most empowering aspects of computer science education. This is also a great place to train your problem-solving skills, which will pay off across all areas of study.

There are hundreds of books on the subject, but our favorite is [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693/?pldnSite=1) by Steven Skiena. He clearly loves solving problems algorithmically and typically manages to spark the same enthusiasm in his students and readers. In our opinion, the two most commonly recommended texts (CLRS and Sedgewick) tend to be too focused on proofs for those who primarily learn the material as a means of practical problem-solving.

For those who prefer video lectures, [Skiena has generously posted his online](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/373/videos/). We also like Tim Roughgarden's course, available [on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) and [elsewhere](http://timroughgarden.org/videos.html). Whether you prefer Skiena’s or Roughgarden’s lecture style is a matter of personal preference. In fact, there are dozens of good alternatives. So if you find one you like, we recommend sticking with it!

For practice, we recommend that students solve problems on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/). These tend to be interesting problems with good accompanying solutions and discussions. They also help you measure your progress through questions commonly asked in technical interviews at competitive software companies. We suggest solving around 100 random Leetcode problems during your studies.

Finally, we recommend [How to Solve It](https://www.amazon.com/How-Solve-Mathematical-Princeton-Science/dp/069116407X/?pldnSite=1) as an excellent and unique guide for general problem-solving, which is just as applicable to computer science as it is to mathematics.
