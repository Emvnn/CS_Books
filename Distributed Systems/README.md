As computers have become more numerous, they have also become more distributed. While companies used to invest in ever-larger mainframes, today it is common for even very small applications to run on multiple machines. Distributed systems deal with the trade-offs associated with this shift.

Our recommended book for self-study is [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable-ebook/dp/B06XPJML5D/?pldnSite=1). Unlike a traditional textbook, DDIA is a highly readable book designed for practitioners, without sacrificing depth or thoroughness.

For those looking for a more traditional read, or one that is freely available online, we suggest [Distributed Systems, 3rd Edition](https://www.distributed-systems.net/index.php/books/ds3/) by Maarten van Steen and Andrew Tanenbaum.

If you prefer video lectures, an excellent course with online videos is [MIT's 6.824](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQP8WApzIQQ&list=PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-WkMbsvGQk9_UB), a graduate-level course by Robert Morris, with [accompanying materials](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html).

Regardless of which textbook or secondary sources you choose, studying distributed systems requires reading research papers. A great list can be found [here](http://dsrg.pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/), and we highly recommend joining your local chapter of [Papers We Love](https://paperswelove.org/).
